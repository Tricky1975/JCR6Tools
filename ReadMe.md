# JCR 6 Tools
This repository contains some handy tools for creating and managing JCR6 files.
This repository contains

- PyJCR - A powerful tool written in Python
- GJCR (coming soon) - A GUI based tool (written in BlitzMax) you can use to analyizing (and creating) JCR6 files.

This repository is only a copy! It will not make sense to modify any of its contents as they will be reset ot the original on my next update, and my update tool will do so without remorse and most likely also without me noticing that.
