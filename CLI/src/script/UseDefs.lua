     I licensed all included Lua Scripts under the MPL in stead of the GNU.
     The reason is simple. Yes I do want to be Open-Source and to force you to
     keep them that way. However I DON'T want you to be obligated to take over
     my license for your own JCR6 scripts, and since your scripts will automatically
     link to these, your scripts would automatically become GNU GPL licensed due to
     the "viral" effect of this license. That's all there's to it folks!
